The main features the Econt API has are the following:
- calculating the price of a shipment
- creating a loading and generating PDF for print, validation of the loading data
- request for courier
- checking the status of a loading, COD, tracing the loading
- information about the Econt offices
- information about the cities served by Econt
- information about the streets and quarters in the cities
- information about e-econt user and his address for sending and receiving shipments

Requests and responses of the API are in XML format and described in this manual - http://www.econt.com/e-econt/doc_templates/XML_manual.pdf
English version - http://www.econt.com/e-econt/doc_templates/XML_manual_engl.pdf

For calculation, validation and preparing a loading the same request is used, with the only difference being in the value of tags <validate> and <only_calulate>
Example requests for preparing a loading: parcel_import.xml, parcel_import_ro.xml

When preparing a shipment the addresses of a sender, receiver, or third parties(for receiving COD, returning a loading, etc.) are necessary to be valid by the following criteria:
1. Valid post code and name of a city.
2. At least one of the following:
 - valid street name (<street>) and number (<street_num>)
 - valid quarter name (<quarter>) and value in filed "other" (<street_other>)
 - for cities with no data for streets: street name without validation (<street>) and number (<street_num>)
 - for loadings upon request: valid Econt office code (<office_code>)

For calculating the delivery price for shipping enough data is valid city, sender and receiver post code.

Valid names of cities, streets and quarters can be received with API request to http://www.econt.com/e-econt/xml_service_tool.php:
- cities and post codes : <request_type>cities</request_type> 
- offices:  <request_type>offices</request_type>
- quarters: <request_type>cities_quarters</request_type>
- streets: <request_type>cities_streets</request_type> 
Example requests: offices_request.xml, cities_request.xml

It is also possible to give the client the option of choosing the office on a map, by using the Econt office locator.
Minimal example implementation for choosing an office with the locator can be viewed here: http://ee.econt.com/office_locator_example.html

The XML requests are sent via HTTP/HTTPS POST with one of these formats (which ever is most convenient):
- as a file attachment with Content-type: multipart/form-data (the same as a browser submitting a form with a file input)
- as a form parameter named 'xml' and Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the same as a browser submitting a form with a text input named 'xml')
- as raw POST data and Content-type: text/xml

The URLs for the endpoints are:
- for creating/calculating shipments, money transfers and requests for courier visits:
 * test environment - http://demo.econt.com/e-econt/xml_parcel_import2.php
 * production environment - http://www.econt.com/e-econt/xml_parcel_import2.php
- for all other requests (getting data for offices, cities, streets, profile info and others):
 * test environment - http://demo.econt.com/e-econt/xml_service_tool.php
 * production environment - http://www.econt.com/e-econt/xml_service_tool.php

For the test system you can use the following username: iasp-dev and password: iasp-dev
For the production system you can use already existing e-econt account, or register new one at https://ee.econt.com/load_direct.php?target=Register

Currently, authorization with SSL client certificates is not supported, but you can use SSL connection and authorize in the usual way(in the XML request)

In xml_api_example.php is shown how to send a request to the API and how to convert PHP arrays from/to XML. The example contains only required fields and most commonly used services.
